                Hi, we are the guys from Analytix_Web :) In this documentation, you can make your changes just before you read and agree to the license agreement.
                <h2 class="headline">Started</h2>
                Analytix_Web has many API connections with Google servers, Yandex, Github.  From these services we get data from different JSON formats or XML markup.
                <br>
                In addition: If the site and the Analytix_Web service fail, the entire documentation will be on our repository on
                <div class="code-string">
                    <p>git clone https://github.com/analytixgroup/AnalytiXProject.git</p>
                </div>
                In this example, you can see how to transfer user data.
                <h2 class="headline">JSON</h2>
                <div class="code-string">
                    <p>var employees = [</p>
                    <p>{"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},</p>
                    <p>{"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},</p>
                    <p>{"firstName":"Peter","lastName": "Jones"}</p>
                    <p>];</p>
                </div>
                <h2 class="headline">Attention! It is very important.</h2>
                The extension of Analytix_web is under development and improvement of the user interface, so do not think that the extension, the service works without glitches, bugs and all sorts of other horrible errors.
                <br>
                Therefore, we ask you to skip the script layouts for us (working with which you can interact) to improve the serviceability of the service.
                <br>
                It is worth noting that we also have our own built-in library ACTIVE.JS To start using it, paste this code on the format page: .html or .php
